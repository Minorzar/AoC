This is the repository of my work on the Advent of Code 2023 code

## Day 1:

# Puzzle 1

    The idea is to look for each caracter of the line and check if it's a number. The option I went with is to
    add all result inside an array then add the first number find time ten and the last.

    The code works and I got the star.

# Puzzle 2

    The idea is the same as puzzle 1 but now to also check for instance of number in text. The option I went with
    is to check first for all instances, add them with their index, check for number the sort the array by the
    index and do the same operation.

    The code works and I got the star.

## Day 2

# Puzzle 1

    The idea is to decompose each game into pieces (each set of cube) then to get the value before the color and
    check if it's greater or not than one of the limits.

    The code works and I got the star.
